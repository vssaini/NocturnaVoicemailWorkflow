## üìñ How It Works

1. **RingCentral** sends a webhook with voicemail and transcription data to the Azure Function endpoint.
2. The function parses and validates the payload.
3. It saves relevant details (caller, recipient, transcription text, voicemail URL) into the **Azure SQL Database**.
4. It writes the transcription and metadata into a excel file.
